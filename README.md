# World Builder CPP

This project is a simple Windows Forms application written in C++/CLI. It demonstrates an entity system and a basic form for a resource management game.

## Building
Make sure Visual Studio with C++/CLI support is installed. Open a
*Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio* and run the provided
`build.bat` script. It invokes the C++/CLI compiler with the required options:

```cmd
build.bat
```

This produces `WorldBuilder.exe`, which starts the Windows Forms application.

## Running
Execute `WorldBuilder.exe` after compiling. The main form displays a
placeholder status label that updates every second.

Future development can expand on this skeleton to implement the full game
mechanics.
