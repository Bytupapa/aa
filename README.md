# World Builder CPP

This project is a simple Windows Forms application written in C++/CLI. It demonstrates an entity system and a basic form for a resource management game.

## Building
1. Open `WorldBuilderCPP/WorldBuilderCPP.vcxproj` in Visual Studio (tested with Visual Studio 2022).
2. Build the project using either **Debug** or **Release** configuration.

## Running
After a successful build, run the generated executable from Visual Studio. The main form displays a placeholder status label that updates every second. Future development can expand on this skeleton to implement the full game mechanics.
